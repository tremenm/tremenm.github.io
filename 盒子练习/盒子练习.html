            <h3>Mojito</h3>
            <p>Traditionally, a mojito is a cocktail that consists of five ingredients: white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, soda water, and mint.The original Cuban recipe uses spearmint or yerba buena, a mint variety very popular on
                the island.Its combination of sweetness, refreshing citrus, and mint flavors is intended to complement the potent kick of the rum, and has made this clear highball a popular summer drink.</p>

            <h3>Margarita</h3>
            <p>The margarita is a cocktail consisting of tequila, triple sec and lime or lemon juice, often served with salt on the rim of the glass.The drink is served shaken with ice (on the rocks), blended with ice (frozen margarita), or without ice (straight
                up). Although it has become acceptable to serve a margarita in a wide variety of glass types, ranging from cocktail and wine glasses to pint glasses and even large schooners, the drink is traditionally served in the eponymous margarita glass,
                a stepped-diameter variant of a cocktail glass or champagne coupe.</p>
